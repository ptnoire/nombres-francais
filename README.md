# Simple French Learning App

I was practicing my french and needed to just have numbers displayed to me at random, so I made this. Probably something out there already, doesn't matter, I just like to build. I will expand this to encapsulate more numbers (probably for the user to set a range)

## May 9th, 2023

Things I want to add:

- Days of the Week.
- Months
- Dates (The 1st, etc..)
- Next (week, month, day..) & Last ..
- Prices, just adding decimals to the numbers.
